# Data-analysis-pandas-
Adult Income Prediction analyzes the Adult dataset to predict if a person earns over $50K. Includes EDA, handling missing values, duplicates, and bivariate analysis. Uses Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Titanic Survival Analysis explores survival rates based on class, age, and gender with similar EDA techniques.

# üìä Titanic & Adult Dataset Analysis

## üìå Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the **Titanic** and **Adult** datasets, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.

---

## üìÇ Datasets
- **Titanic Dataset**: Information on Titanic passengers, including demographics and survival status.
- **Adult Dataset**: Census data to predict whether an individual earns more than $50K per year.

---

## üîß Data Preprocessing
### ‚úÖ Steps Taken:
1. **Checked for missing values** and handled them accordingly.
2. **Removed duplicate rows** to ensure data integrity.
3. **Converted categorical variables** into numerical representations.
4. **Normalized and cleaned data** for better model performance.

## ‚ùì Questions & Answers

### üö¢ Titanic Dataset

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ How many rows and columns are in the dataset?
**Answer:** The dataset has **`titanic.shape[0]` rows** and **`titanic.shape[1]` columns**.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What are the data types of each column?
**Answer:**
- `titanic.info()` gives an overview.
- Some columns are **numerical** (e.g., `Age`, `Fare`), while others are **categorical** (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`).

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Are there missing values in the dataset?
**Answer:**
- Yes, `titanic.isnull().sum()` shows missing values in **Age, Cabin, and Embarked** columns.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ How did we handle missing values?
**Answer:**
- `Age`: Filled with the **median** age.
- `Cabin`: Dropped due to too many missing values.
- `Embarked`: Filled with the most **frequent** value.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Are there duplicate rows?
**Answer:**
- Checked using `titanic.duplicated().any()`.
- Removed duplicates with `titanic.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)`.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ What is the distribution of age?
**Answer:**
- **Summary:** `titanic['Age'].describe()`.
- **Visualization:** `sns.histplot(titanic['Age'], kde=True)`.

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ What was the survival rate for different classes?
**Answer:**
- **Survival by class:** `titanic.groupby('Pclass')['Survived'].mean()`.
- **Visualization:** `sns.barplot(x='Pclass', y='Survived', data=titanic)`.

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the survival rate of males vs. females?
**Answer:**
- `titanic.groupby('Sex')['Survived'].mean()`.
- Women had a higher survival rate than men.

#### 9Ô∏è‚É£ What is the relationship between fare and survival?
**Answer:**
- **Boxplot:** `sns.boxplot(x='Survived', y='Fare', data=titanic)`.
- **Insight:** Higher fares are linked to better survival rates.

### üè† Adult Dataset

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ How many rows and columns are in the dataset?
**Answer:** The dataset has **`adult.shape[0]` rows** and **`adult.shape[1]` columns**.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What are the data types of each column?
**Answer:**
- `adult.info()` provides an overview.
- Some columns are **categorical**, while others are **numerical**.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Are there missing values in the dataset?
**Answer:**
- `adult.isnull().sum()` shows missing values in **workclass, occupation, and native-country**.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ How did we handle missing values?
**Answer:**
- Replaced `"?"` with `NaN` using `replace()`.
- Dropped missing values using `dropna()`.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Are there duplicate rows?
**Answer:**
- Checked using `adult.duplicated().any()`.
- Removed duplicates using `adult.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)`.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ What is the distribution of age?
**Answer:**
- **Summary:** `adult['age'].describe()`.
- **Visualization:** `adult['age'].hist()`.

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ What is the most common workclass?
**Answer:**
- `adult['workclass'].value_counts()` shows that **"Private"** is the most common workclass.
- **Visualization:** `sns.countplot(x='workclass', data=adult)`.

#### 8Ô∏è‚É£ How many people have a Bachelor's or Master's degree?
**Answer:**
- `sum(adult['education'].isin(['Bachelors','Masters']))` gives the count.

#### 9Ô∏è‚É£ What is the income distribution?
**Answer:**
- **Visualization:** `sns.countplot(x='income', data=adult)`.
- **Observation:** The majority of people earn **<=50K**.

#### üîü How was the income column transformed?
**Answer:**
- **Replaced categorical income values:**
  ```python
  adult.replace(to_replace=['<=50K', '>50K'], value=[0,1], inplace=True)
  ```
